## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript




### Continued development

It was one of my beginner projects. I mainly used HTML, Javascript and CSS. It was great experience to learn how to make themes using those programming languages. 

For my next projects, I will consider using much easier ways to provide themes, rather than styling each of them with CSS.
